## Background on Project 

* This was a solo project created in 12 hours with API's I have never used before. In that short amount of time I was able to teach myself several important skills such as implementing API's, setting up a server for post and get request as well as parsing html and json information. These skills would later prove themselves useful in my first co-op.


## Reflection 

* Often companies are looking for someone with a specific skill. If you do not know JavaScript like the back of your hand you will not be hired. While knowing the skill that you are applying to is important in almost every profession, I feel programming has some wiggle room. Programming is an art form, the ability to create something from practically nothing. We are not merely following a process like many other fields; rather we are creating and becoming the process. The Hello World program is truly the greatest program ever written in my opinion because it opens up a world of possibilities. An easy way to find a passionate programmer is to ask them the first time they ever wrote the infamous "Hello World". If their response is "The first day of Computer Science I", red flags should be raised. Companies should not hire associates who were merely taught a skill they are looking for in a classroom, rather those who are willing and have the passion to take the leap of faith without the comfort of a classroom to teach themselves and create their own projects.


* Concepts can be taught,


* Skills must be desired.
