# MAPSms
Wentworth Institute of Technology : Softmore 2016

## Tools/APIs

## Background on Project 

* This was a solo project created in 12 hours with API's I have never used before. In that short amount of time I was able to teach myself several important skills such as implementing API's, setting up a server for post and get request as well as parsing html and json information. These skills would later prove themselves useful in my first co-op.
